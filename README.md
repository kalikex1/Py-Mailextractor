<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Certainly! Here's a sample short documentation for the two Python scripts:</p><h2>GUI-Mailextractor</h2><p>GUI-Mailextractor is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using PyQt5 for extracting email addresses from CSV and Excel files.</p><h3>Usage</h3><ol><li>Run the script using the command <code>python GUI-mailextractor.py</code>.</li><li>Click on the "Browse" button to select a folder containing CSV and Excel files.</li><li>Click on the "Extract Emails" button to start the extraction process.</li><li>The extracted emails will be saved to a file named "email_addresses.txt" in the selected folder.</li><li>A message box will be displayed when the extraction is complete, showing the path of the output file.</li></ol><h2>CLI-Extractor</h2><p>CLI-Extractor is a command-line interface (CLI) version of GUI-Mailextractor, providing a simplified way to extract email addresses from CSV and Excel files.</p><h3>Usage</h3><ol><li>Run the script using the command <code>python CLI-Extractor.py</code>.</li><li>Enter the path to the folder containing the CSV and Excel files when prompted.</li><li>The script will process the files and extract the email addresses.</li><li>The extracted emails will be saved to a file named "email_addresses.txt" in the same folder.</li><li>Once the extraction is complete, a message will be displayed indicating the location of the output file.</li></ol><p>Both scripts utilize the <code>pandas</code> library to handle CSV and Excel file parsing, and the <code>re</code> library for email address extraction using regular expressions.</p><p>Please note that the GUI-Mailextractor script requires the PyQt5 library to be installed (<code>pip install PyQt5</code>), and the CLI-Extractor script requires <code>pandas</code> and <code>openpyxl</code> libraries (<code>pip install pandas openpyxl</code>).</p><p>For more detailed usage instructions and code implementation, please refer to the script files themselves.</p><p>Feel free to modify the documentation to include additional details or information specific to your project.</p></div>
